					Welcome to the MIT Badminton club. Our mission is to help all players, of all skill levels, seeking to improve their play.</br><br /> 
The MIT Badminton club is <strong>only open to MIT affiliates (students, faculty, staff, alum or spouse of any of the above, although current students are given waitlist priority if the club is too full)</strong>. These rules are set by the Club Sports Council at MIT and cannot be waived.  <strong>For members of the general public who would like to play badminton at MIT, you may check the MIT <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/recschedule.pdf">open recreational schedule</a>. These hours are updated weekly, and are <i>not</i> linked to the MIT Badminton Club in any way. Due to COVID-19, as of September 2021 we will be requiring masks while playing (and at all other times). Tryouts for Fall 2021 have concluded; if you wish to join the waitlist can just email us (mitcbac-officers[at]mit[dot]edu) indicating your playing level/experience.</strong>  For non-students, you may also need to get a MIT DAPER membership as day-passes are not available anymore (for the foreseeable future, as of Sept 2021. You can always find the latest information <a href="http://www.mitrecsports.com/recreation%20-reopening/">from DAPER here</a>). <br /> <br /> 

The MIT Badminton club is for players who are seeking to improve. Our mission is to help players of <i>all skill levels</i> improve their play, and we spend around 50% of our court times doing training drills with our coach. Recreational players should refer to the MIT <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/recschedule.pdf">open recreational schedule</a>. <br /> <br /> 
For more information about joining, please click <a href="faqs.html">here</a>. Our club typically reaches capacity for beginner/intermediate players quickly; those wishing to join the waitlist should email us (please tell us your playing history/experience). We typically hold practices on Tues/Thurs evenings. <br /> 
<br /> 
To contact us, you can email us at mitcbac-officers[at]mit[dot]edu. Please note that we cannot assist with open recreational badminton hours and these queries should be directly addressed to the MIT Z-Center staff.
