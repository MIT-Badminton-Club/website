								<p>Firstly, please make sure you are not looking for <a href="http://intramurals.mit.edu/important-dates/sports-leagues/">Intramural Badminton</a>, the MIT Badminton <a href="https://physicaleducationandwellness.mit.edu/options-for-points/course-catalog/">PE class</a>, or  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/recschedule.pdf">open rec badminton</a>.  The MIT Badminton club is only open to MIT affiliates (students, alum, faculty, staff, or spouse of any of the above). These rules are set by the Club Sports Council at MIT and cannot be waived. For members of the general public who would like to play badminton at MIT, you may find the open recreational schedule <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/recschedule.pdf">here</a>. These hours are updated weekly, and are <strong>not</strong> linked to the MIT Badminton Club in any way.
								<br /><br />
								We also charge dues of $30 per semester.  Tryouts for Fall 2022 have concluded; if you wish to join the waitlist for either our advanced or beginner sections please fill out <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/1xqrkKwDeCZixEqw9">this form</a></strong>. Due to our extensive waitlist for the beginnerintermediate section, we highly encourage players of intermediate skill level to play <a href="http://intramurals.mit.edu/important-dates/sports-leagues/">intramural badminton</a> and beginners to sign up for the <a href="https://physicaleducationandwellness.mit.edu/options-for-points/course-catalog/">PE class</a>.  Please note that priority is given to students over postdocs/faculty/alumni/spouses if the club becomes too full.<br /> </br>  
								Joining the MIT badminton club involves paying club dues of <strong>$30 each semester</strong> to encourage regular attendance to practices. Please make this out as a cheque to MIT Badminton Club OR bring as cash to your first or second practice. The club generally meets on <strong>Tuesday and Friday evenings</strong>. Members of our competitive team may sometimes have additional weekend invitation-only practices.<br /> 
								<br /> 
								Due to damage to the Rockwell Cage floor, <strong>only players with non-marking soles will be allowed to play</strong> during club times. If you are not sure about your shoes, please ask a club officer. To prevent injury to players, we will not allow players with non-athletic attire (e.g. jeans) to play during club-reserved times.<br /> 
								<br /> 
								Club Sports has introduced a new online waiver system (<a href="http://clubsports.mit.edu/join-a-club/">click here to fill it out</a>) - please note that due to MIT regulations, <strong>you will not be allowed to play unless you have completed the online waiver</strong>. The new online waiver is different to last year's, and so all players, including returning ones, should complete this waiver online every year.<br /> 
								<br /> 
								You will be added to the club mailing list once we receive your club dues.</a><br /> 
								<br /> 
				
								You can contact us with any questions at mitcbac-officers[at]mit.edu.</p>
